# my-qtile_picom-config
personal qtile config originally based on DT's config (https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles/-/tree/master/.config/qtile?ref_type=heads) 
but heavily modified to work better for me

autostart.sh based on the one from ArcoLinux (https://github.com/arcolinux/arcolinux-qtile/blob/master/etc/skel/.config/qtile/scripts/autostart.sh)

qtile folder in .config/
picom.conf in /etc/xdg/
